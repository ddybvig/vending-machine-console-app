# vending-machine-console-app

This is a console application that simulates a vending machine. I built it using Maven in NetBeans. The inventory data for
the machine is persisted in a .txt file. This file is read from/written to each time the user selects an item. This project
represents a pretty major milestone for me. The version of it that I brought into my initial code review was far below
expectations. It was the process of revising this project that really helped me grasp the concept of passing by value and 
throwing/catching exceptions. This was also the first project for which I wrote a comprehensive set of tests.
